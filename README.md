# tic-tac-toe
A Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript lets two players (X and O) take turns marking a 3x3 grid. HTML structures the grid, CSS styles it for better visuals, and JavaScript manages game logic—checking for wins, draws, and switching turns—providing real-time feedback on the game outcome.
